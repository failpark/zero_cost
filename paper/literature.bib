	abstract = {The authors introduce a new programming language concept, called typestate, which is a refinement of the concept of type. Whereas the type of a data object determines the set of operations over permitted on the object, typestate determines the subset of these operations which is permitted in a particular context. Typestate tracking is a program analysis technique which enhances program reliability by detecting at compile-time syntactically legal but semantically undefined execution sequences. These include reading a variable before it has been initialized and dereferencing a pointer after the dynamic object has been deallocated. The authors define typestate, give examples of its application, and show how typestate checking may be embedded into a compiler. They discuss the consequences of typestate checking for software reliability and software structure, and summarize their experience in using a high-level language incorporating typestate checking.},

	abstract = {This paper discusses features of a secure systems programming language designed and implemented at IBM's Watson Research Lab. Two features of the language design were instrumental in permitting security to be enforced with minimum run-time cost: (1) Language constructs (e.g. pointer variables) which could result in aliasing were removed from the programmer's direct control and replaced by higher level primitive types; and (2) traditional strong type checking was enhanced with typestate checking, a new mechanism in which the compiler guarantees that for all execution paths, the sequence of operations on each variable obeys a finite state grammar associated with that variable's type. Examples are given to illustrate the application of these mechanisms.},

	abstract = {We formulate a typed formalism for concurrency where types denote freely composable structure of dyadic interaction in the symmetric scheme. The resulting calculus is a typed reconstruction of name passing process calculi. Systems with both the explicit and implicit typing disciplines, where types form a simple hierarchy of types, are presented, which are proved to be in accordance with each other. A typed variant of bisimilarity is formulated and it is shown that typed β-equality has a clean embedding in the bisimilarity. Name reference structure induced by the simple hierarchy of types is studied, which fully characterises the typable terms in the set of untyped terms. It turns out that the name reference structure results in the deadlock-free property for a subset of terms with a certain regular structure, showing behavioural significance of the simple type discipline.},
